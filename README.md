<h1>IP SleepDeprived Slimepedia Website</h1>

A Genshin website that allows users to collect Genshin characters as slimes. Players answer trivia questions to unlock new information on the characters, and get rewards.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

The Slimepedia website is targeted at Genshin Players looking to know more about Genshin Characters or get in-game rewards like Primogems or Character Materials.
The website will reward users for answering trivia questions correctly, and 2 different kinds of trivia will be displayed: Character Trivia and Genshin Trivia.
A Slimepedia acts as a encyclopedia to store information that users have collected about the characters.

- As a user, I want to know more about Genshin Characters, so that I can deepen my knowledge of the game
- As a user, I want to get Primogems and Character Materials for my Genshin account, so that I can pull for more characters and upgrade my characters
- As a user, I want to test my knowledge of the game, so that I can see how much I know about Genshin
- As a user, I want a convenient location to store the Character information I have unlocked, so that it would be easier for me to access

<h2>Features</h2>

The Slimepedia website would consist of:

1. A login page for users to sign in using their Genshin accounts
2. A homepage for users to access the Character Trivia, Genshin Trivia and Slimepedia pages
3. A profile button for users to access the shop and sign out
4. A shop section for users to see their Primogems and convert them over to their Genshin Accounts
5. A Character Trivia page to display Character Questions and buttons with their answers, a 30 second countdown timer for the questions and a help button for users to give the question they are struggling with to another user
6. A Genshin Trivia page to display general Genshin Questions and buttons wth their answers, a 30 second countdown timer for the question and display of the user's unlocked character <strong>(If a favourite character has not been selected, a random character is chosen)</strong>
7. A Slimepedia page for the user to see the image of the character, information unlocked of the character and the 3D model of the character

Future Features:

- The help option would give the question to another player who logged in
- If a question the user requested for help for is answered correctly, the user would be given the rewards the next day
- Gives the user Character Materials for the 1st, 10th and 20th questions of each character answered
- More Characters would be added for more content
- Implement the convert 160 Primogems for new character information in the shop
